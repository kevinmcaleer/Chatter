# User Account Management - GitHub Issue #27

## User Stories

### Registration
**As a** new user
**I want to** register for an account
**So that** I can participate in comments and track my activity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can access registration page at `/register`
- Form collects: first name, last name, username, email, date of birth (optional), password
- Username and email must be unique
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- Form errors are displayed inline within the form (not as JSON)
- Successful registration redirects to login page
- All validation errors are shown in user-friendly format

### Login
**As a** registered user
**I want to** log in to my account
**So that** I can access my profile and manage my activity

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can access login page at `/login`
- Form collects: username and password
- Invalid credentials show error message in the form (not JSON)
- Successful login redirects to account page at `/account`
- Login session persists via secure HTTP-only cookie
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attempts (5 attempts per minute)

### Account Management
**As a** logged-in user
**I want to** manage my account details
**So that** I can keep my information up to date

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can access account page at `/account`
- User can view their username (read-only, cannot be changed)
- User can update their email address
- User can change their password
- User can view activity statistics (likes, comments)
- User can view their comment history
- User can delete their account
- All form errors display inline (not as JSON)
- Email validation shows user-friendly errors
- Password change requires current password verification

### Logout
**As a** logged-in user
**I want to** log out of my account
**So that** I can secure my session

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can logout via `/logout` endpoint
- Logout clears the authentication cookie
- Logout redirects to login page

### Admin Panel
**As an** administrator
**I want to** manage user accounts
**So that** I can maintain security and help users with account issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin can access admin panel at `/admin` (admin-only access)
- Admin panel displays list of all users with:
  - Username
  - Full name (first and last)
  - Email address
  - User type (Admin or User badge)
  - Account status (Active or Inactive)
  - Last login timestamp
  - Account creation date
  - Password reset indicator (badge when reset is required)
- Admin can force password reset for any user (except themselves)
- Forced password reset triggers warning badge on user row
- Admin actions show success/error messages
- Admin panel includes back button to account page
- Admin button is visible on account page for admin users only

### Forced Password Reset
**As a** user whose password reset was forced by admin
**I want to** be prompted to change my password on next login
**So that** I can secure my account with a new password

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User is redirected to password reset page after successful login
- Password reset page explains admin has required password change
- Form collects new password and confirmation
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- Passwords must match
- Form errors display inline (not as JSON)
- After successful reset, user is redirected to account page
- Reset flag is cleared from user account
- User can proceed normally after password is changed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Error Handling
**All errors must be handled gracefully in the UI:**
- Form validation errors must be displayed inline within the form that triggered them
- Errors must NOT be returned as JSON responses to form submissions
- Error messages must be user-friendly and actionable
- Each form should display errors in context (e.g., "Email already registered" appears near email field)
- Server errors should show generic "Something went wrong" message to users
- Technical error details should only be logged server-side

### Security
- Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt
- Authentication uses JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Cookies must use `secure` flag in production (HTTPS only)
- Cookies must use `samesite=lax` to prevent CSRF
- Rate limiting on login endpoint (5 requests per minute)
- Session tokens expire after 30 minutes

### User Experience
- All pages must use consistent Kev's Robots branding
- Forms must have clear labels and placeholders
- Success messages must be shown for completed actions
- Page titles must be descriptive
- Navigation must be intuitive with clear links
- Mobile-responsive design using Bootstrap 5.3.3

### Performance
- Forms must validate on both client and server side
- Database queries must use proper indexing
- Pages must load in under 2 seconds

## Technical Implementation

### Routes
- `GET /register` - Show registration form
- `POST /register` - Process registration (form data)
- `GET /login` - Show login form
- `POST /login` - Process login (form data)
- `GET /logout` - Logout and redirect
- `GET /account` - Show account management page
- `POST /account/update` - Update email
- `POST /account/change-password` - Change password
- `POST /account/delete` - Delete account
- `GET /admin` - Show admin panel (admin-only)
- `POST /admin/force-password-reset/{user_id}` - Force password reset (admin-only)
- `GET /force-password-reset` - Show forced password reset form
- `POST /force-password-reset` - Process forced password reset

### API Routes (for backward compatibility)
- `POST /api/register` - JSON API endpoint (deprecated)
- `POST /api/login` - JSON API endpoint (OAuth2)

### Templates
- `base.html` - Base template with navigation and footer
- `register.html` - Registration form
- `login.html` - Login form
- `account.html` - Account management page
- `admin.html` - Admin panel with user management
- `force_password_reset.html` - Forced password reset form

## Testing Requirements
- All endpoints must have unit tests
- Form validation must be tested
- Error handling must be verified for all edge cases
- Security measures must be tested (password hashing, rate limiting)
- Code coverage must be at least 80%
