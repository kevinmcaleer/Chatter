## üê≥ Docker Deployment (Issue #31)

### Docker Configuration

- [x] **Create Dockerfile**
  - ‚úÖ Multi-stage build for optimized image size
  - ‚úÖ Runs as non-root user (UID 1000)
  - ‚úÖ Health checks included
  - ‚úÖ PostgreSQL client for migrations
  - Location: `Dockerfile`

- [x] **Create docker-compose.yml**
  - ‚úÖ Application service configuration
  - ‚úÖ Optional PostgreSQL service
  - ‚úÖ Optional nginx reverse proxy
  - ‚úÖ Volume mounts for data and logs
  - ‚úÖ Health check dependencies
  - Location: `docker-compose.yml`

- [x] **Create migration system**
  - ‚úÖ schema_version table for tracking migrations
  - ‚úÖ Automatic migration on container startup
  - ‚úÖ Idempotent - safe to restart containers
  - ‚úÖ Migrations won't re-run if already applied
  - Location: `docker-entrypoint.sh`, `migrations/versions/schema_version.sql`

- [x] **Create environment configuration**
  - ‚úÖ .env.docker template with all variables
  - ‚úÖ .dockerignore for excluding files
  - ‚úÖ Documentation for external vs internal DB
  - Location: `.env.docker`, `.dockerignore`

- [x] **Create deployment helpers**
  - ‚úÖ Makefile with common Docker commands
  - ‚úÖ Build, run, logs, shell, backup commands
  - ‚úÖ Production push to local registry (192.168.2.1:5000)
  - Location: `Makefile`

- [x] **Create documentation**
  - ‚úÖ Full deployment guide (DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md)
  - ‚úÖ Quick reference (README.Docker.md)
  - ‚úÖ Troubleshooting section
  - ‚úÖ Migration system explanation

### Docker Deployment Steps

1. [x] **Build image**
   ```bash
   make build
   # or: docker build -t chatter:latest .
   ```

2. [ ] **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.docker .env
   # Edit .env with production values
   ```

3. [ ] **Test locally**
   ```bash
   make run
   make logs
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

4. [ ] **Push to registry** (if using 192.168.2.1:5000)
   ```bash
   make deploy-prod
   ```

5. [ ] **Deploy on production server**
   ```bash
   docker pull 192.168.2.1:5000/kevsrobots/chatter:latest
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Migration System Features

The Docker deployment includes an intelligent migration system:

**Features:**
- Waits for database to be ready (up to 60 seconds)
- Checks `schema_version` table for applied migrations
- Runs only missing migrations
- Records each migration with timestamp
- Idempotent - safe to restart multiple times
- No manual migration steps needed

**How it works:**
1. Container starts ‚Üí `docker-entrypoint.sh` executes
2. Waits for database connection
3. Creates `schema_version` table if needed
4. Checks which migrations are applied
5. Runs missing migrations in order
6. Starts FastAPI application

**Migrations tracked:**
- `schema_version` - Version tracking table itself
- `000_create_initial_schema` - All tables (user, accountlog, like, comment)
- `001_add_account_management_with_logging` - Account management and logging
- `002_add_last_login_tracking` - Last login timestamps
- `003_add_force_password_reset` - Admin password reset functionality

### Docker Registry Setup

**Using local registry (192.168.2.1:5000):**

```bash
# On development machine
make deploy-prod

# On production server
docker pull 192.168.2.1:5000/kevsrobots/chatter:latest
docker tag 192.168.2.1:5000/kevsrobots/chatter:latest chatter:latest
docker-compose up -d
```

**Without registry (export/import):**

```bash
# Save image
docker save chatter:latest | gzip > chatter.tar.gz

# Transfer to server
scp chatter.tar.gz user@server:/tmp/

# Load on server
docker load < /tmp/chatter.tar.gz
docker-compose up -d
```

### Docker Health Checks

Built-in health monitoring:

```bash
# Check status
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' chatter-app

# Should show: healthy
```

Health check hits `/health` endpoint every 30 seconds.

### Docker Security

- ‚úÖ Runs as non-root user (chatter, UID 1000)
- ‚úÖ Multi-stage build (minimal attack surface)
- ‚úÖ No secrets in image (uses environment variables)
- ‚úÖ Minimal dependencies
- ‚úÖ Health checks for monitoring
- ‚úÖ Read-only filesystem option available

### Next Steps for Docker Deployment

1. [ ] Test Docker build completes successfully
2. [ ] Test with external PostgreSQL database
3. [ ] Verify migrations run on first start
4. [ ] Verify migrations don't re-run on restart
5. [ ] Set up local registry at 192.168.2.1:5000
6. [ ] Configure nginx reverse proxy (optional)
7. [ ] Set up SSL certificates for HTTPS
8. [ ] Configure automated backups
9. [ ] Set up monitoring/alerting
10. [ ] Document rollback procedures
