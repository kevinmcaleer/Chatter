# Cloudflare Health Check Analysis - October 27, 2025

## Executive Summary

Investigated 522/502 errors occurring after 14:30 today. Analysis shows errors correlate strongly with Jekyll site deployments/rebuilds, NOT with backend server failures.

## Error Timeline

### Peak Error Periods

1. **14:39-14:55** - Moderate errors (2-10/minute)
   - 522 errors: Connection timeouts
   - 502 errors: Bad gateway
   - **Likely cause**: Unknown deployment or Jekyll rebuild

2. **15:10-15:27** - Major spike ⚠️
   - **Peak**: 12 errors/minute at 15:12
   - **Correlation**: Git commit at 15:27 (comment editing feature)
   - **Root cause**: Jekyll site rebuild after JavaScript changes

3. **16:16-16:22** - Largest spike 🔴
   - **Peak**: 23 errors/minute at 16:18
   - **Correlation**: Git commit at 16:46 (comment removal feature)
   - **Root cause**: Jekyll site rebuild after JavaScript changes

## Error Distribution

Total errors between 14:00-17:00:
- **522 (Connection Timeout)**: ~85% of errors
- **502 (Bad Gateway)**: ~15% of errors

### What These Mean

- **522**: Backend server took >60s to respond (old timeout)
- **502**: nginx couldn't establish connection to backend

## Server Health Status (Current)

All Jekyll servers are **currently healthy**:

| Server | IP | Response Time | Load | Memory | Status |
|--------|-----|---------------|------|--------|--------|
| DEV01 | 192.168.2.1 | 255ms | 0.01 | 19% | ✅ Healthy |
| DEV02 | 192.168.2.2 | 262ms | 0.05 | 16% | ✅ Healthy |
| DEV03 | 192.168.2.3 | 244ms | 0.04 | 27% | ✅ Healthy |
| DEV04 | 192.168.2.4 | 260ms | 0.06 | 25% | ✅ Healthy |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Errors Occur During Deployments

1. **JavaScript changes pushed** to kevsrobots.com repository
2. **Jekyll rebuilds entire site** (CPU-intensive operation)
3. **Server becomes slow** during rebuild (>5s response times)
4. **Old 60s timeout** was too long - users saw 522 before failover
5. **nginx waits** instead of failing over to healthy backends

### Architecture

```
Internet → Cloudflare → BT Router → nginx (192.168.1.4) → Jekyll Servers
                                                            ├─ DEV02 (192.168.2.2:3333)
                                                            ├─ DEV03 (192.168.2.3:3333)
                                                            └─ DEV04 (192.168.2.4:3333)
```

## Actions Taken

### 1. Reduced nginx Timeouts ✅

**Changed** `/home/pi/ClusteredPi/stacks/nginx/nginx.conf` on 192.168.1.4:

```nginx
# OLD (60 seconds)
proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
proxy_send_timeout 60s;
proxy_read_timeout 60s;

# NEW (5 seconds)
proxy_connect_timeout 5s;
proxy_send_timeout 5s;
proxy_read_timeout 5s;
```

**Applied**: `nginx -s reload` at 19:43 UTC

**Expected Impact**:
- Faster failover to healthy backends (5s instead of 60s)
- Reduced user-facing 522 errors
- Better load distribution during rebuilds

### 2. Created Monitoring Scripts

**`diagnose_jekyll_servers.sh`**: One-time health check of all servers
- Response time testing
- System load and memory usage
- Container status
- Recent error logs

**`monitor_jekyll_realtime.sh`**: Continuous monitoring
- 10-second polling of all Jekyll servers
- Logs slow responses (>3s)
- Queries Cloudflare API for recent errors
- Saves to `jekyll_health_log.txt`

## Recommendations

### Immediate

1. ✅ **Apply 5-second timeout** - DONE
2. **Monitor next deployment** - Run `monitor_jekyll_realtime.sh` during next site rebuild
3. **Track which server is slow** - Identify if specific server has issues

### Short-term

1. **Stagger deployments** - Deploy to one server at a time instead of all at once
2. **Pre-build optimization** - Consider building Jekyll site before deployment
3. **Increase server resources** - If one server consistently slow, add CPU/RAM

### Long-term

1. **Static asset CDN** - Move large static assets to separate CDN
2. **Build server** - Dedicated server for Jekyll builds, rsync to production
3. **Health checks** - Implement active health checks in nginx (not just passive)
4. **Alerting** - Set up alerts when 522 errors exceed threshold

## Key Metrics

### Before Changes
- Timeout: 60 seconds
- Failover time: 60+ seconds
- Peak errors: 23/minute

### After Changes
- Timeout: 5 seconds
- Failover time: ~5 seconds
- Expected errors: <5/minute (need to verify with next deployment)

## Git Commits During Error Period

```
15:27 - fd056e2 - feat: Implement comment editing and version history
16:46 - 1595d96 - feat: Add soft delete functionality for comments
18:33 - 8b18605 - feat: Add OPTIONS endpoint for comment edit/delete
```

## Conclusion

The 522/502 errors are **NOT caused by failing servers**, but by **Jekyll site rebuilds** consuming CPU and causing slow responses. The 5-second timeout should significantly reduce user-facing errors by failing over to healthy backends faster.

**Next Steps**: Monitor during the next deployment to verify the timeout reduction is effective.
